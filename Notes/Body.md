RainWeavor is a textile installation that invites rain to become a co-creator. It transforms real-time weather data—such as rainfall rhythm, intensity, and pH—into tufted carpet patterns. Rain is no longer a passive subject to be recorded, but an active designer collaborating with the machine to shape every inch of the weave.

We regard rain as part of the urban ecosystem—not something to be controlled, but welcomed into the design process. The textures on each carpet stem from real rainfall volume and density, resembling the traces rain leaves on the ground. Each piece becomes a tangible memory of weather—a dialogue between humans and nature anchored in time and space.

The project seeks to awaken environmental sensitivity in our daily lives. RainWeavor turns rain from a source of inconvenience into a poetic language that writes the breathing rhythm of the city. As people gently touch the fabric, the varying densities of tufted threads become a tactile diary of the rainy season.
